We broke into 6 groups consisting of 4 students each. One student in each group acted as the team lead. Each group was tasked with coming up with their solution to this problem by building the website from the ground up as they saw fit.

<b>Our Client:</b> A Biology professor

<b>Requirement:</b> In short a Biology professor expressed a desire to have a Prionser's Dilemma website using an unspecified number of classes, each with an unspecified number of students.

<b>Outcome:</b>
